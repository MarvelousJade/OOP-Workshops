In this workshop, I learned how to organize a C++ program into multiple modules using namespaces and separate compilation. I discovered how separating code into header and implementation files enhances code readability and maintainability. Implementing the seneca namespace helped prevent naming conflicts across modules.
One challenge I faced was setting up compilation safeguards correctly. I initially received multiple inclusion errors due to missing include guards in my header files. I resolved the issue by adding proper #ifndef, #define, and #endif directives to each header file. This ensured that each header was included only once during compilation.
This experience has shown me the importance of modular programming and careful project organization. I am confident that these skills will be invaluable in tackling more complex coding tasks ahead.
Overall, the workshop was challenging but rewarding, and it significantly enhanced my understanding of C++ programming practices.
